Central: Chicago Bulls, Cleveland Cavaliers, Detroit Pistons, Indiana Pacers, Milwaukee Bucks

Southeast: Atlanta Hawks, Charlotte Hornets, Miami Heat, Orlando Magic, Washington Wizards

Over the years, NBA has become increasingly popular internationally. According to a Twitter study, NBA was the most discussed sports league in 2018. We are interested in the following question:

Does the popularity of a NBA team correlate with its profitability?
A) Business Understanding
In order to conduct a quantitative analysis, I will acquire data from various sources, structure and consolidate them to build indicators for the popularity and profitability of a NBA team:

use the engagement of a team on twitter as an indicator of its popularity
use the sales of a teamâ€™s tickets as a basic proxy to its profitability
Also use of additional data to enhance the analysis
1) Problem Definition
It is obvious that professional sports in the United States, as in several other countries, are profit driven institutions in an intensely competitive entertainment industry. As profit-driven entities, sport franchises strive to increase revenues from various sources, primarily ticket sales and television contracts. NBA teams aim to achieve such a performance level.

Based on a study called "Poor performance Benchmarking: An International Journal" [reference = Vol. 13 No. 3, 2006 pp. 252-271 Emerald Group Publishing Limited], it is estimated to have cost NBA teams $5.3-7.8 million a year, in ticket sales alone, depending on ticket prices and the actual capacity[3]. This conservative estimate does not include any playoff games revenue, potential television or radio contract revenues, or any other related business revenues. Such large incremental revenue, for operations with a predominantly fixed cost structure, can make a significant difference in profits
