# Pictet Case Study: Does the popularity of a NBA team correlate with its profitability?

## 1) Problem Definition
It is obvious that professional sports in the United States, as in several other countries, are profit driven institutions in an intensely competitive entertainment industry.
As profit-driven entities, sport franchises strive to increase revenues from various
sources, primarily ticket sales and television contracts. NBA teams aim to achieve such a performance level.

Based on a study  called "Poor performance Benchmarking: An International Journal" [reference = Vol. 13 No. 3, 2006 pp. 252-271 Emerald Group Publishing Limited], it is estimated to have cost NBA teams $5.3-7.8 million a year, in ticket sales alone, depending on ticket prices and the actual capacity. Such large
incremental revenue, for operations with a predominantly fixed cost structure, can
make a significant difference in profits.

## 2) Goal

Hence, NBA teams are eager to find which channels of communications can influence their profits by dragging more fans to their stadiums, potential television or radio contract revenues, or any other related business revenues.

Therefore, to conduct a quantitative analysis, I will acquire data from various sources, structure and consolidate them to build indicators for the popularity and profitability of NBA teams:
- use the engagement of a team on twitter as an indicator of its popularity
- use the sales of a teamâ€™s tickets as a basic proxy to its profitability
- Also use additional data to enhance the analysis as winning percentages
